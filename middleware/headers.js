/*
* Cross Origin Resource Sharing
    - mechanism that uses additional HTTP headers to tell browsers to give a web application running at one origin access to selected resources from a different origin.

    1: a response header that tells the browser to allow code form any origin.

    2: a response header that specifies the method or methods allowed when accessing the resources to a preflight request.

    3: a response header that's used in response to a preflight request that indiciates which HTTP headers can be used during the actual request.

*Preflight Requests:
    - A preflight request is a CORS request that checks to see if the CORS protcol is understood.
    - automatically issued by a browser.
    ex: client might ask a server if it would allow a DELETE request before actually sending the DELETE request.
